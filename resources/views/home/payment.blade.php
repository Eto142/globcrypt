                <p style="color:black">1.2 Company's financial responsibility starts with the first record of a customer's deposit and continues up to a full withdrawal of funds.</p>
                
              
                <p style="color:black">1.3 The client has the right to demand from the Company any amount of funds which is available in his/her account at the time of the enquiry.</p>
                
            
				<p style="color:black">1.4 The only official methods of deposits/withdrawals are the methods which appear on the company's official website. The client assumes all the risks related to the usage of these payment methods since the payment methods are not the company's partners and not the company's responsibility. The company is not responsible for any delay or cancellation of a transaction which was caused by the payment method. In case the client has any claims related to any of the payment methods, it is his/her responsibility to contact the support service of the particular payment method and to notify the company about those claims.</p>

In case any fraud is detected during or after a financial transaction, the company reserves the right to cancel such a transaction and freeze the client's account.
The Company's responsibility for the clients' funds ends when the funds are withdrawn from the company's bank account or any other account related to the company.</p>
                
				
                <p style="color:black">1.6 In case of any technical mistakes related to financial transactions, the company reserves the right to cancel such transactions and their results.</p>
                

                <p style="color:black">1.7 The client may have only one registered account on the company's website.

                <p style="color:black">In order to make a deposit, the client shall make an inquiry at his Personal Cabinet.
